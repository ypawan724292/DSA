/**
 * Merge sort : Best and worst case time complexity is O(n log n)
 * Heap sort : Best and worst case time complexity is O(n log n)
 * Quick sort : Best case time complexity is O(n log n) and worst case time complexity is O(n^2)
 * Bubble sort : Best case time complexity is O(n) and worst case time complexity is O(n^2)
 * Selection sort : Best and worst case time complexity is O(n^2)
 * insertion sort : Best case time complexity is O(n) and worst case time complexity is O(n^2)
 *
 * Hashtable lookup time : Best complexity is O(1) and be O(n) in worst case
 * Hashtable implementation : HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap in java/kotlin
 *
 * Estimation of 2^24 = 2^10 * 2^10 * 2^4 = 1024 * 1024 * 16 = 16777216
 *
 * Data Structure to Implement the Priority Queue:
 * A priority queue can be efficiently implemented using a binary heap.
 * A binary heap is a complete binary tree where each node is smaller (min heap) or larger (max heap) than its children.
 *
 *
 * When to Use a Queue in Graph Algorithms:
 * BFS (Breadth-First Search): A queue is used to keep track of the nodes that are next in line to be explored. BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
 * DFS (Depth-First Search): Typically implemented using recursion or a stack, not a queue. DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
 * Recursion: Not directly related to the use of a queue. Recursion is a method of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
 *
 *
 * Average time complexity for lookup in a self-balancing binary search tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
 * Worst time complexity for lookup in a self-balancing binary search tree is O(log n).
 *
 * Among Quicksort, Merge sort, Insertion sort, and Bubble Sort, Bubble Sort is considered the most inefficient
 * for large datasets due to its average and worst-case time complexity of (O(n^2)).
