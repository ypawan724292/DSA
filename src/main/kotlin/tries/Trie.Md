Quick Checklist
Ask yourself:

Does the problem involve prefix matching, substring counting, or common string patterns? → Likely a Trie problem.
Is fast lookup, insertion, or prefix querying needed? → Trie is helpful.
Are you working with a large dictionary of words or strings? → Trie can save space and time.
