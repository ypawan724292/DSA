# Questions to Ask the Interviewer on Interval-Type Problems

## Clarification on Input and Output
- Can you clarify the format of the input intervals? Are they always sorted?
- Should the output intervals be sorted in any specific order?

## Edge Cases
- How should the function handle empty input intervals?
- What should be done if the intervals are overlapping or touching at the boundaries?

## Constraints
- Are there any constraints on the size of the input intervals?
- Are the intervals guaranteed to be non-overlapping initially?

## Performance
- What is the expected time complexity for the solution?
- Are there any specific performance requirements or limitations we should be aware of?

## Special Cases
- How should the function handle intervals with negative values?
- Are there any special cases we should consider, such as intervals with the same start or end points?

## Implementation Details
- Is there a preferred programming language or data structure to use for this problem?
- Should the solution be optimized for readability or performance?

## Testing
- Are there any specific test cases you would like to see covered?
- How should the function handle invalid input, such as intervals with the start greater than the end?
