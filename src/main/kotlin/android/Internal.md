# Internal Working of Retrofit, Lifecycle, WorkManager, and Glide

## ðŸ“‰ 1. Retrofit: Internal Working & Lifecycle
Retrofit is a **type-safe HTTP client** for Android that simplifies API calls using **OkHttp** under the hood.

### ðŸš€ How Retrofit Works Internally?
1. **Define API Interface**
    - Uses annotations (`@GET`, `@POST`, etc.) to define API requests.

2. **Retrofit Creates a Dynamic Proxy**
    - Uses **Java Reflection** to create a **proxy class** that implements the API interface dynamically.
    - This proxy class calls OkHttp for network execution.

3. **OkHttp Intercepts and Executes the Request**
    - The request is delegated to **OkHttp**, which applies:
        - **Interceptors** (for logging, authentication, caching).
        - **Connection Pooling** (to reuse network connections).
        - **Threading Mechanism** (to run requests on background threads).

4. **Response Handling**
    - The **Converter Factory** (e.g., Gson, Moshi) parses the JSON response into a Kotlin/Java object.
    - The **CallAdapter** converts responses into **LiveData, Coroutines, or RxJava**.

5. **Main Thread Dispatching**
    - The parsed response is dispatched to the **UI thread** using Android's main thread dispatcher.

## ðŸ“‰ 2. Lifecycle: Internal Working & Execution Flow
Android **Lifecycle** is a part of Jetpack that helps manage UI components' lifecycles (e.g., Activities & Fragments).

### ðŸš€ How Lifecycle Works Internally?
1. **`LifecycleOwner` (Activity/Fragment)**
    - Implements `LifecycleOwner`, which is responsible for tracking its lifecycle states.

2. **`LifecycleObserver` (Observers like ViewModel, Services, etc.)**
    - Components like **ViewModel or LiveData** register observers to listen for lifecycle changes.

3. **`LifecycleRegistry` (State Manager)**
    - A `LifecycleRegistry` keeps track of lifecycle **states and transitions**.
    - It automatically notifies registered observers when the **Activity/Fragment state changes**.

4. **Event Dispatching to Observers**
    - Lifecycle events like `ON_CREATE`, `ON_RESUME`, `ON_DESTROY` are dispatched to the observer components.

## ðŸ“‰ 3. WorkManager: Internal Working & Execution Flow
WorkManager is a Jetpack component for **background tasks** that **survive app restarts**.

### ðŸš€ How WorkManager Works Internally?
1. **Task Enqueueing (OneTime/Periodic Work)**
    - A `WorkRequest` (OneTime/Periodic) is created with constraints like **Network, Battery, or Charging**.

2. **Job Scheduling with WorkerManager**
    - WorkManager **delegates** work to `JobScheduler`, `AlarmManager`, or a custom thread pool.
    - Work is executed based on **priority, constraints, and system health**.

3. **Execution on Worker Thread**
    - Runs the `doWork()` function in the **background** using:
        - `JobScheduler` (Android 6.0+)
        - `AlarmManager + BroadcastReceiver` (Older versions)
        - `Executor ThreadPool` (for immediate tasks)

4. **Work Completion & Result Handling**
    - WorkManager updates the job status (`SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `RETRY`).
    - If work fails, **exponential backoff** is applied for retries.

## ðŸ“‰ 4. Glide: Internal Working & Execution Flow
Glide is a **powerful image loading library** that optimizes image loading, caching, and rendering.

### ðŸš€ How Glide Works Internally?
1. **Request Creation**
    - A Glide request is created with `.load(url).into(imageView)`.

2. **RequestManager Handles Caching**
    - Checks if the image exists in:
        - **Memory Cache** â†’ Fastest retrieval.
        - **Disk Cache** â†’ Loads from local storage.
        - **Network** â†’ Fetches from the internet if not cached.

3. **Background Thread Execution**
    - If an image isn't cached, Glide:
        - Fetches it in a **background thread**.
        - Decodes & scales it based on **ImageView size**.
        - Applies transformations (e.g., `circleCrop()`).

4. **Bitmap Pooling for Reuse**
    - Glide reuses Bitmaps using **LruCache** and **BitmapPool** to avoid memory churn.

5. **Rendering on UI Thread**
    - Once the image is loaded, it's posted back to the **main thread** using `Handler`.

## ðŸš€ Summary Table
| Library | Purpose | Internal Execution |
|---------|---------|--------------------|
| **Retrofit** | API Calls | Uses **OkHttp**, Interceptors, and Reflection to execute network calls |
| **Lifecycle** | Manage UI Lifecycle | Uses **LifecycleRegistry** to notify components of state changes |
| **WorkManager** | Background Work | Uses **JobScheduler & Executors** for task execution |
| **Glide** | Image Loading | Uses **Caching & Thread Pooling** for optimized performance |
